# Xinghuan_pdf_scraping_coding_sample
This is Xinghuan's public repository for his coding sample of pdf scrapping. I use pdfpluber package of python to scrape an unorganized pdf table without explicity lines between rows and columns. The sample's name is "Xinghuan_coding_sample_pdfplumber.py" and the original pdf's name is "original_table_pdfplumber.pdf". The name of the scraping output is "CWC Software, Inc..csv".
